# Introduction
To continue advancing more inclusive computer vision, the Google Skin Tone Team worked with TONL LLC to curate the Monk Skin Tone Examples (MST-E) dataset. MST-E is a dataset of exemplars of 19 people spanning the 10-point MST scale. It contains 1515 images and 31 videos. Each person was photographed in various poses and lighting conditions. Some models elected to also take pictures with accessories such as masks and glasses. Dr. Monk then annotated the images of these people, providing us the ground-truth MST skin tones.

The primary goal of this dataset is to **enable practitioners to teach human annotators and test for consistent skin tone annotations across various environment capture conditions such as high and low lighting**. Ultimately, this aids in making AI-driven products work better for people of all skin tones.
